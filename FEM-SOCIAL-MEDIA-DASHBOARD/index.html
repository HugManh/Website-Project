    <h1>VS Code Workflow</h1>
    <p>
      When you’ve hit that flow state, your brain often travels at a hundred
      miles per hour. You type out your code as quickly as you can, working hard
      to capture your thoughts before they disappear into the ether or recesses
      of another thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visual Studio Code has been the rising star of code editors since it came
      out. For a long time, I resisted — not because it’s another code editor to
      try out, but rather because I had my entire workflow in Sublime sorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the code and work are essentially the same — no matter which editor
      I ended up using — my productivity and output plummeted in the first week
      when I made the move to Visual Studio Code.
